# odin-hashmap

A HashMap created as part of the Odin Project.

The HashMap utilizes singly-linked lists for each bucket.

I didn't make use of the code snippet as the methods ensure that a non-existent hash key isn't accessed.

The demonstration adds and removes books to / from a bookshelf.

HashMapKeys is a similar structure but with keys only.
